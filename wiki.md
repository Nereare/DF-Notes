This project doesn't aim to be a wiki to Dwarf Fortress at all. There is already a vast and masterwork-quality [Dwarf Fortress Wiki](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/), to which you must go if you have any gameplay doubts.

This site aims to be a repository for some schematics that I use more often, and to serve as inspiration to others seeking schematics and organizational designs.

Please, do visit the [Dwarf Fortress Wiki](http://dwarffortresswiki.org/)!
