![Schematics]({{ '../../assets/imgs/Fuel-Smelt-Industry.png' }})

#### Legend

* **A**: Wood furnace (`b`, `e`, `w`).
* **B**: Smelter (`b`, `e`, `s`), which must be set to use only from the Coal and Fuel Stockpiles.
* **C**: Metalsmith's Forge (`b`, `w`, `f`).
* **D**: Smelter (`b`, `e`, `s`), which must be set to use only from the Fuel, Flux, Ore and Metal Bars stockpiles.

## Industries

Note that the sizes on the schematics are for demonstration only, you may scale as you see fit.

### Fuel Industry

The yellow part of the schematics represent the fuel industry, which rely on a source or either wood, coal ore&#42; or both. This industry uses the fuel&#42;&#42; available on the Metal Industry to smelt coal ore into fuel.

&#42; **Coal ore** may refer to either lignite or bituminous coal.

&#42;&#42; **Fuel** refers to both coal and charcoal, they are interchangeable and work in the same way under almost all conditions, save when dealing with ~~filthy~~ elves.

### Metal Industry

The red part of the schematics represent the metal industry, which takes the output from the fuel industry and the ores from mining to smelt metal bars.

This industry layout is capable of steel forging, given the necessary ingredients. If you don't want or can't forge steel, remove the Flux Stockpile.
