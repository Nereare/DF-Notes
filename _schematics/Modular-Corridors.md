## Modules

This schematics feature a `1:1` square proportion.

Each section of hallway (**B**) should always be 3sq-wide, and must be at least 3sq-long (**F**), and at most 11sq-long (**E**).

The nexus (**A**) must have a column in its center, unless it is a stair nexus, in which case a 3x3 stair must either run through it (Up/Down Stairs), or begin/end at it (Up or Down Stairs). Every nexus may connect on either of its four faces (**C**) with a 3x1 recess and a bifurcation into the corridor proper (**D** and **F**).

Rooms must connect only with nexi (**A**, **C**), not the hallways (**B**, **E**). They must connect in the same way as corridors: with a 3x1 recess and a bifurcation. The doors must be placed on the bifurcation spaces (hence, 2 doors by connection).
