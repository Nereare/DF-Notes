**Note** that this schematics are derived and work upon [Modular Corridors](Modular-Corridors.md).

### Small Floor Design

This schematics feature a `1:1` square proportion. The large white squares with an `S` are stairs. The small brown squares are doors.

This design features a central space that is not meant for rooms, it may either be a central column of support for the fort, or you may dig it up and have a central hollow shaft running across all the fort's floors - you may even open this shaft to the outter world!

Should you use the hollow shaft, consider installing windows (glass: `b`-`y`, gem: `b`-`Y`) on the nexi.
